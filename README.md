# Analysis-of-Suicide-Data


Four datasets are used for this project:

1) Data on suicides is available from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/szamil/who-suicide-statistics The underlying information was compiled by Kaggle user Szamil on the basis of data obtained from the World Health Organization's Mortality Database, see https://apps.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/mortality/whodpms/.

2) Data on Life Expectancy is obtained from the website OurWorldInData.org. The website lists as its original source of information:
James C. Riley (2005) – Estimates of Regional and Global Life Expectancy, 1800–2001. Issue Population and Development Review. Population and Development Review. Volume 31, Issue 3, pages 537–543, September 2005., Zijdeman, Richard; Ribeira da Silva, Filipa, 2015, "Life Expectancy at Birth (Total)", http://hdl.handle.net/10622/LKYT53, IISH Dataverse, V1, and UN Population Division (2019)

3) Data on Mental Health is also obtained from OurWorldInData.org. It gives the original source:
Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network. Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 (GBD 2017) Results. Seattle, United States: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), 2018.

4) Finally, data on the Human Development Index comes from OurWorldInData.org, which in turn gives the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) as their source.
